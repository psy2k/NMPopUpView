NMPopUpView
===========

Simple class for iOS that shows nice popup windows. 

To use it in your application, just import `PopViewController.h`, `PopViewController.m` (or `PopViewControllerSwift.swift` if you want to use the swift version), `PopViewController.xib` and `PopViewController_iPad.xib` files (or the `NMPopUpViewController` group from the example project) in your project and call the pop up using this code in Swift:
`````swift
var popViewController : PopUpViewController = PopUpViewControllerSwift(nibName: "PopUpViewController", bundle: nil)
popViewController.title = "This is a popup view"
popViewController.showInView(self.view, withImage: UIImage(named: "typpzDemo"), withMessage: "You just triggered a great popup window", animated: true)
```````````
or this code in Objective-C
`````objective-c
PopUpViewController *popViewController = [[PopUpViewController alloc] 
                                         initWithNibName:@"PopUpViewController" bundle:nil]; 
[popViewController setTitle:@"This is a popup view"];
[popViewController showInView:self.view 
                   withImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"yourImage"] 
                   withMessage:@"Your Message" animated:YES];
```````````
